-- Solution

Select name,  bonus
From Employee
Left Join Bonus On Employee.empId=Bonus.empId
Where bonus<1000 Or bonus Is Null

-- Notes

/*
This query selects the names of all employees along with their bonus amounts by performing a LEFT JOIN 
between the Employee and Bonus tables based on the employee ID. It then filters the results to include 
only those employees whose bonus is less than 1000 or who have no bonus recorded (NULL). This way, all 
employees with a small bonus or no bonus at all are included in the output.
